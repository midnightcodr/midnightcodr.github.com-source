## Ideas
Inspired by [http://lifehacker.com/5872323/diy-ikea-monitor-stand-for-12](http://lifehacker.com/5872323/diy-ikea-monitor-stand-for-12), I decided to make a monitor stand that can support 2 LCD monitors.

I settled down on the following parts:

- The boards: [EKBY TRYGGVE softwood shelf](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30094629/#/10094630)
- The legs: [CAPITA 6" standless stell leg](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20049538/#/00054564)

Since one board needs 6 legs (I wouldn't try with 4 legs only) I ended up bying 2 boards and 3 packs of legs (12 legs total) so I can make an extra stand for my work place.

Final material cost (per stand): $25.

## The making and the result
