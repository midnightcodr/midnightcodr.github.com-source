## So it's for real
I've always wanted to build a standing desk using Ikea parts. Other people have done it with Finnvard height adjustable table legs ([http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00144763/](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00144763/)) and a table top. My plan was put off because the Long Island Ikdea store discontinued the Finnvard legs for some time. I was lucky to find them in-store again this weekend and Voil√† - my dream desk is finally built:

I bought this $40 stool just incase I need to take a short break from standing:

I also like the fact that I am able to stuff my laser printer onto the shell:

## Here's the recipe

1 x Linnmon table top, [http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50251350/](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50251350/), $40

2 x Finnvard table legs [http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00144763/](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00144763/), $30 ea

1 x Tertial Work lamp, [http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20370383/](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20370383/), $9

Total: $109+Tax

## Note

I didn't do some serious hack to increase the height of the table legs like this guy did [http://www.ikeahackers.net/2014/02/convert-the-finnvard-into-a-height-adjustable-standing-desk.html](http://www.ikeahackers.net/2014/02/convert-the-finnvard-into-a-height-adjustable-standing-desk.html) because the legs are able to reach upto 36 5/8, with 1" for the table top, the final result is 37 5/8, which is pretty close to my ideal desk height (the height where elbows can rest on the table top).
